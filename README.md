Welcome to 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course by Google!
What is the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive?
This 5-day online course was crafted by Google’s ML researchers and engineers to help developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents. You’ll learn the core components – models, tools, orchestration, memory and evaluation. Finally, you’ll discover how agents move beyond LLM prototypes to become production-ready systems.

Each day blends conceptual deep dives with hands-on examples, codelabs, and live discussions. By the end, you’ll be ready to build, evaluate, and deploy agents that solve real-world problems.
